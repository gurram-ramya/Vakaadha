Here is the structured list of what still needs to be integrated. I’ve grouped them by **component/service** and sorted in the logical order you should tackle them:

---

## 1. **Catalog (Products)**

* ✅ Fetch products dynamically (done).
* Add support for multiple product images (carousel/gallery per product).
* Product detail page (deep link from product card).
* Filtering and sorting (by size, price, category).
* Pagination or “load more” support.

---

## 2. **Cart Service**

* API endpoints to:

  * Add item to cart.
  * Remove item from cart.
  * Update quantity.
  * Fetch current cart contents.
* Frontend cart page (`cart.html`) to render items, total price, checkout button.
* Cart persistence (per user session or DB).

---

## 3. **Wishlist Service**

* API endpoints to:

  * Add/remove items to wishlist.
  * Fetch wishlist items.
* Frontend integration (`wishlist.html`) to show saved items.
* Sync wishlist with logged-in user account.

---

## 4. **Orders / Checkout**

* API endpoints to:

  * Place an order (convert cart → order).
  * Fetch past orders for user.
* Frontend (`orders.html`): order history page.
* Order confirmation flow (modal or redirect).

---

## 5. **Users / Authentication**

* API endpoints for:

  * User registration.
  * Login (JWT/session).
  * Logout.
  * Profile fetch/update.
* Frontend integration (`profile.html`):

  * Login/signup forms.
  * Logged-in view (My Orders, Wishlist, Addresses).

---

## 6. **Addresses**

* API endpoints to:

  * Add/edit/delete user addresses.
  * Fetch saved addresses.
* Frontend (`addresses.html`) for address management.

---

## 7. **Inventory Management**

* Sync inventory with product variants.
* Decrement stock on order placement.
* Prevent checkout if item out of stock.
* Admin-side APIs for restocking (future).

---

## 8. **Payments (Later Stage)**

* Payment gateway integration (Razorpay/Stripe).
* Backend order → payment verification callback.
* Payment status stored with order.

---

## 9. **Admin / Management (Future)**

* Admin portal for:

  * Adding/editing products.
  * Uploading images.
  * Managing orders and inventory.
* Role-based access control.

---

## 10. **Enhancements / Utilities**

* Toast notifications for actions (add to cart, wishlist, copy link).
* Share modal deep link support.
* SEO (meta tags, structured data).
* Security hardening (CSP headers, input sanitization).
