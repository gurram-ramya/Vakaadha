For evertime when the new databse is created i need to add the UID for the demo user and admin credentials

Email = demo@vakaadha.com
Password = demo123 

For the admin user:

Email = admin@vakaadha.com
Password = admin123

use the following SQL code to update the database manually.
UPDATE users
SET firebase_uid = 'g6fo07uffmgujuBqHUmytPx0Nvl1'
WHERE email = 'admin@vakaadha.com';

UPDATE users
SET firebase_uid = 'Aw5ULMn0nFhntiKOjKE9FttzMOG2'
WHERE email = 'demo@vakaadha.com';
