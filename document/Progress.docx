Progress So Far
Database

✅ Rebuilt users table (email, phone, Firebase UID, role, status, etc.).

✅ Added user_profiles for extended info (dob, gender, avatar).

✅ Wishlist table exists and linked to users/products.

✅ Schema initialized and seeded with demo users (demo@local, admin@local).

Backend

✅ utils/auth.py — Firebase-based token auth (require_auth).

✅ domain/users/service.py — implemented user CRUD, profile, addresses.

✅ routes/users.py — implemented:

/login, /me

/users/me (update profile)

/users/me/addresses (CRUD)

/users/me/wishlist (planned, we’ll wire with frontend next).

⚠️ Cart routes pending (next step).

Frontend

✅ api/client.js — central API client with token handling.

✅ auth.js — cleaned up login/logout/signup (Firebase + token storage).

✅ profile.html + profile.css + profile.js — cleaned, modular, Amazon-style profile page.

✅ wishlist.html + wishlist.css + wishlist.js — completely rewritten:

Guest vs logged-in handling.

Secure API usage (users/me/wishlist).

Product cards with “Move to Cart” + “Remove.”

🔹 Next Steps

Finish Cart (cart.html + cart.js + cart.css).

Wire backend routes for wishlist and cart (routes/users.py + routes/cart.py).

Then proceed to Orders → Order history & tracking.

After that: Admin flows (product management, inventory).
